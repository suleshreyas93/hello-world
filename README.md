Tutorial Repository
I am Computer Science graduate currently in my second semester at Stevens Institute of Technology. I eagerly look forward towards the prospect of internship the organization is offering.”Science is about knowing, engineering is about doing”, inspired by the above statement and pragmatically rich subjects like Data Structures, Analysis and Algorithm design, Web engineering, Database Management Systems, augmented my desire to learn and hone the skill set outside the classroom studies.
 I strongly believe that a software engineer should be instinctive, innovative, and quick to adapt and adopt to new technologies which is only possible with solid foundation and profundity in these subjects. Owing to this fact, and with keen interest in the object oriented programming methodology and above mentioned subjects, I always encouraged myself to be at the edge of current technologies by indulging in different projects right from the early days of second year engineering at my college. “The best way to predict your future is to create it”, is what drives my enthusiasm and urge to excel and make the best use of every learning opportunity. 
I am confident that given a chance I will be able to match the high standards set by your company. I assure you of my sincerity, dedication and hard work to live up to your expectations. Looking forward anxiously to join your esteemed company.
